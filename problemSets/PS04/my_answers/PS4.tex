\section*{Question 1: Economics}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	
In this question, use the \texttt{prestige} dataset in the \texttt{car} library. First, run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
install.packages(car)
library(car)
data(Prestige)
help(Prestige)
\end{verbatim} 


\noindent We would like to study whether individuals with higher levels of income have more prestigious jobs. Moreover, we would like to study whether professionals have more prestigious jobs than blue and white collar workers.

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Create a new variable \texttt{professional} by recoding the variable \texttt{type} so that professionals are coded as $1$, and blue and white collar workers are coded as $0$ (Hint: \texttt{ifelse}).
	
	\vspace{0.05cm}
		
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
			Prestige$professional <- ifelse(Prestige$type == "professional", 1, 0)
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		This code creates a new variable \texttt{professional} in the \texttt{Prestige} dataset by recoding the variable \texttt{type}. Professionals are coded as 1, and blue and white collar workers are coded as 0.
	\end{enumerate}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(b)]
	Run a linear model with \texttt{prestige} as an outcome and \texttt{income}, \texttt{professional}, and the interaction of the two as predictors (Note: this is a continuous $\times$ dummy interaction.)
	
	\vspace{0.05cm}
		
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
			model <- lm(prestige ~ income * professional, data = Prestige)
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		This code runs a linear model with \texttt{prestige} as the outcome variable and \texttt{income}, \texttt{professional}, and their interaction as predictors.
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
		\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(c)]
	Write the prediction equation based on the result.
	\vspace{0.05cm}
	
	\begin{enumerate}[(c)]
		To write the prediction equation based on the result, you can use the following code in R:
		
		\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
			summary(model)
		\end{lstlisting}
		
		This code provides a summary of the linear model, including the coefficients and the prediction equation.

	What is the effect of a \$1,000 increase in income on prestige score for professional occupations?

Calculate the change in $\hat{y}$ associated with a \$1,000 increase in income based on your answer for (c).

\section*{Question 2: Political Science}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent 	Researchers are interested in learning the effect of all of those yard signs on voting preferences.\footnote{Donald P. Green, Jonathan	S. Krasno, Alexander Coppock, Benjamin D. Farrer,	Brandon Lenoir, Joshua N. Zingher. 2016. ``The effects of lawn signs on vote outcomes: Results from four randomized field experiments.'' Electoral Studies 41: 143-150. } Working with a campaign in Fairfax County, Virginia, 131 precincts were randomly divided into a treatment and control group. In 30 precincts, signs were posted around the precinct that read, ``For Sale: Terry McAuliffe. Don't Sellout Virgina on November 5.'' \\

Below is the result of a regression with two variables and a constant.  The dependent variable is the proportion of the vote that went to McAuliff's opponent Ken Cuccinelli. The first variable indicates whether a precinct was randomly assigned to have the sign against McAuliffe posted. The second variable indicates
a precinct that was adjacent to a precinct in the treatment group (since people in those precincts might be exposed to the signs).  \\

		In the output of the \texttt{summary(model)} function, we can look at the R-squared value, which measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data. Additionally, we can examine the p-values for the coefficients of the independent variables to assess their significance in explaining the variation in the dependent variable. This information will help us understand the importance of yard signs versus other factors that are not modeled in the regression.
